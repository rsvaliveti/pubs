  abstract	= {A fundamental problem in information theory and pattern
		  recognition involves computing and estimating the
		  probability density function associated with a set of
		  random variables. In estimating this density function, one
		  can either assume that the form of the density function is
		  known, and that we are merely estimating parameters that
		  characterize the distribution or that no information about
		  the density function is available. This problem has been
		  extensively studied if the random variables are
		  independent. If the random variables are dependent and are
		  of the discrete sort, the problem of capturing this
		  dependence between variables has been studied in Chow and
		  Liu ({IEEE} Trans. Inf. Theory14, 462–467 (May 1968)).
		  The analogous problem for normally distributed continuous
		  random variables has been tackled in Chow et al. (Comput.
		  Biomed. Res.12, 589–613 (1979)). In both these instances,
		  the determination of the best dependence tree hinges on the
		  well-known Expected Mutual Information Measure ({EMIM})
		  Metric. Recently Valiveti and Oommen studied the
		  suitability of the chi-squared based metric in-lieu of the
		  {EMIM} metric, for the discrete variable case (Pattern
		  Recognition25, 1389–1400 (1992)). In this paper, we
		  generalize the latter result and study the use of the
		  chi-squared metric for determining dependence trees for
		  normally distributed random vectors. We show that for such
		  vectors, the chi-squared metric yields the optimal tree and
		  that it is identical to the one obtained using the {EMIM}
		  metric. The computation of the maximum likelihood estimate
		  of the dependence tree is also discussed.},

		  and {SWAP} [14] are two memoryless {DLL} heuristics
		  obtained from natural extensions of the well-known
		  singly-linked-list ({SLL}) heuristics, move-to-front and
		  transposition, respectively. We first derive a general
		  sufficient condition which permits comparison of any two
		  {DLL} heuristics. We use this condition as a guideline to
		  identify families of access distributions for which {SWAP}
		  yields a lower expected cost than the {MTE}. We have also
		  presented an absorbing {DLL} heuristic. The strategy
		  requires one additional memory location and is analogous to
		  the scheme presented in [15]. The reorganization is
		  achieved by moving each element exactly once to its final
		  position in the reorganized list. The scheme is
		  stochastically absorbing and it is shown to be optimal for
		  a restricted family of distributions. Thus, for these
		  distributions, the probability of the scheme converging to
		  the optimal list order can be made as close to unity as
		  desired.},
